            companies in Guntur-Vijayawada and Ongole. Under their able
            leadership, Variant Infra has come a long way, leaving behind
            footprints of excellence across the length and breadth of the city.
            Thanks to their futuristic vision, Variant Infra as a brand is today
            synonymous with Trust, Quality, Assurance, Ethics, Transparency, and
            Affordability. Every single residential or commercial property
            bearing the Harischandra Townships insignia is a fine specimen of
            the highest standards that transcends customer expectations
